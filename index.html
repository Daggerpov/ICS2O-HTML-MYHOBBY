    <p>For HTML Assignment - MY HOBBY, I'll be showing you my favorite hobby: programming. This is something I've enjoyed 
        doing ever since taking your TEJ1O class in my Grade 9 year. I have a lot to talk about in terms of programming and 
        my passion for it, even though it's only been about a year since starting it. 
    </p>
    <p>Unlike other hobbies of mine in the past, this one is different to me. Playing instruments, sports, and video games 
        are all simply leisurely activities that I don't have an interest to pursue as a career. Although, it would be nice 
        to think about it, considering that they can be very enjoyable. I think this is what sets apart programming for me, 
        though. It's something that I plan on learning in college, and then doing in the real world as a job. They say to 
        enjoy what you do for a living, and I think that'll be the case. 
    </p>
    <p>However, as of right now it is a very fun hobby of mine. It doesn't earn me any money just yet, but I still 
        find it quite enjoyable and interesting. It intrigues me due to its depth of knowledge I can get from doing it. 
        Solving problems with programming is really what keeps me going. Figuring out a difficult coding question 
        in Python after long trial and error is very rewarding, and so is finishing a large project of mine. Even just 
        doing these assignments posted on <a href="https://app.schoology.com/" target="_blank">Schoology</a> bring a sense of fulfillment. 
        It's for this reason, that I've decided to pursue doing all three of the options listed on Schoology for Unit 3.
