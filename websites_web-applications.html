    <h2>ICS2O Unit 2 - HTML&CSS Website</h2>
    <p>This website of mine was created in order to complete an assignment for this class, and was the of 
        a few to come. It taught me the basics of using HTML&CSS in tandam together. However, it also made 
        me reflect on all that I've done with programming in the past. You can find the website at 
        <a href="https://codeprojects.org/VVeue4wzYx0iSok2Ab5mWn728kDAxwVegzst6CwRoeE/" target="_blank">this link</a>. 
        That website is being hosted by

    <h2>TER3M Robotics Summative Website</h2>
    <p>As opposed to doing a conventional google docs summative write-up, I actually went ahead and made this website 
        to showcase my summative. It was by far the longest summative anyone had ever seen for robotics. The reasoning
        behind me going this hard at a seemingly simple summative task, was mainly driven by boredom from quarantine. 
        I was looking for ways to constantly grow as a programmer during this year's quarantine, and I figured it would 
        make for a great learning experience, which it most certainly did. This was the first website of mine developed 
        on GitHub, rather than the online text editor we used for the previous one I mentioned. It had me discover how 
        to navigate a file system better, deploy a website, and some other HTML&CSS fundamentals not covered in our 
        Computer Studies class. This website can be found at 
        <a href="https://daggerpov-summative.netlify.app/" target="_blank">this link</a>.

    <h2>Robotics Scouting Web Application</h2>
    <p>Well, this is essentially all my aforementioned robotics summative write-up was about. You can find all 
        information pertaining to it at that same link above.
    </p>

    <h2>ICS2O Unit 3 - MY HOBBY</h2>
    <p>This is just the website you're currently visiting. It was developed entirely in HTML&CSS and is being 
        hosted by 
        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
